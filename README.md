# Social Media App - Frontend React

Made using React and Bootstrap.

A simple social media app that displays posts, tags, number of likes etc. I made this to practice making, editing and saving JS objects in the local storage. Didn't make the UI very visually appealing tho.

## Learnings from this project

- Create react components

-Create Posts
-Add related tags
-Display number of likes
